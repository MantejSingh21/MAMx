# MAMx

Project Title
MAMx

Mission Statement
To provide better maternal health to women living in rural countries by developing accessible medical technologies. Specifically, we intend to develop a fully autonomous software that can analyse and diagnose abnormalities in breast mammograms. This will help resource deficient hospitals in rural countries, which may not have convenient and affordable access to radiologists to manage and diagnose breast cancer in a simple and cost-effective manner.  

Project Summary
We have developed an artificial intelligence software (MAMx) that is currently learning how to read and analyze mammograms in a supervised learning mode. Currently, it can scan 4 mammograms ( RMLO, LMLO, RCC, LCC) in 8 seconds and to date, it has scanned over 2000 mammograms from 500 patients. The mammograms used are digitized according to the following parameters

RIGHT_MLO LINES 4616 PIXELS_PER_LINE 2888 BITS_PER_PIXEL 12 RESOLUTION 50 OVERLAY

Once fully functional and operationally ready, the intention is for the software to scan mammograms, analyze cells and highlight potentially cancerous cells fully autonomously without the need for a radiologist.
To be able to update, refine and improve the parameters of the software, more data is required to by the program to allow it to learn and diagnose more accurately.  Currently, the program can identify cells in all stages of the BI-RADS classification and is approximately 75% accurate in identifying cancerous cells.

Request for support
We hope to work with you to obtain the necessary data and other resources to enable us to refine the programme such that it reaches a the gold standard in diagnostic accuracy and thus allowing us to achieve our mission of improving maternal health and providing accessible care to resource deficient areas.
Also, in the near future, we would also like to implement this technology in radiology departments in various hospitals in Singapore as a means to aid radiologists in diagnosing mammograms in a faster and more accurate manner and thus would like to kindly request your assistance in getting this software piloted in the hospital.
